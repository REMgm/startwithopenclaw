No subscriptions. No cloud. My AI agent runs 24/7 on a $599 Mac Mini.

Here's why self-hosted AI is the future 🧵

Your data never leaves your home. No training on your conversations.
Full GDPR compliance by default.

Tweet 3/5: 2/ Cost Effective
- Mac Mini: $599 one-time
- Power: ~$2/month
- Cloud AI: $20-100/month forever

Pays for itself in 6-12 months.
